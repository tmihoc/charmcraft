# Command 'charmcraft pack'

## Usage:
```text
charmcraft pack [options]
```

## Summary:

Build and pack a charm operator package or a bundle.

You can `juju deploy` the resulting `.charm` or bundle's `.zip` file directly, or upload it to Charmhub with `charmcraft upload`.

For the charm you must be inside a charm directory with a valid `charmcraft.yaml`, `requirements.txt` including the `ops` package for the Python operator framework, and an operator entrypoint, usually `src/charm.py`.  See `charmcraft init` to create a template charm directory structure.

For the bundle you must already have a `bundle.yaml` (can be generated by Juju) and a README.md file.
