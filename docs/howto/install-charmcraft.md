The recommended way to install Charmcraft on Linux is from the `stable` channel via snap:

    sudo snap install charmcraft --classic

There are multiple channels other than `stable`. See the full list with `snap info charmcraft`. 

We recommend either `latest/stable` or `latest/candidate` for everyday charming. With the snap you will always be up to date as Charmhub services and APIs evolve. Charmcraft supports Kubernetes operator development.

In Linux Charmcraft defaults to LXD to build the charms in a container matching the target base(s) (Multipass can also be used). Charmcraft will offer to install LXD if required, but here are steps to set it up manually:

```text
$ sudo snap install lxd
$ sudo adduser $USER lxd
$ newgrp lxd
$ lxd init --auto
```

Charmcraft is [available on homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/charmcraft).

In MacOS Charmcraft defaults to Multipass to build the charms in a container matching the target base(s). Running pack asks to setup Multipass if not already installed, and continues with the packing process:

```text
$ charmcraft pack
Multipass is required, but not installed. Do you wish to install Multipass and configure it with the defaults? [y/N]: y

There is no previously packaged way to install Charmcraft in Windows, please refer to how to install it in an [isolated environment](#heading--isolated).

One way to install Charmcraft is via [Multipass](https://multipass.run/). This is a good way to install it on any platform, as it will give you an isolated development environment. 

First, [install Multipass](https://multipass.run/docs/how-to-install-multipass).

Second, use Multipass to provision a virtual machine. The following command will launch a fresh new VM with 4 cores, 8GB RAM and a 20GB disk and the name 'charm-dev':

```text
$ multipass launch --cpus 4 --memory 8G --disk 20G --name charm-dev
```

Last,  open  a shell in your new Ubuntu virtual machine, and install Charmcraft there:

```text
$ multipass shell charm-dev
...
ubuntu@charm-dev:~$ sudo snap install charmcraft --classic
charmcraft 2.2.0 from Canonical‚úì installed
```

That's it. You can now start typing in Charmcraft commands.
